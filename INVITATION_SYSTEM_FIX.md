# Project Invitation System - Fix Summary

## Problem

When a user received a project invitation and tried to view the project details, they would get an error:

```
Error: Project not found or access denied
```

This happened because the `getProjectById` method only allowed access to:

- Project owners
- Project members

But invitation receivers are **not yet members** - they only become members after accepting the invitation.

## Solution

Updated the `getProjectById` method in `/server/src/services/project.service.ts` to also allow access to users who have **pending invitations** to the project.

### Code Changes

**Before:**

```typescript
async getProjectById(projectId: string, userId: string) {
  const project = await prisma.project.findFirst({
    where: {
      id: projectId,
      OR: [
        { ownerId: userId },
        {
          members: {
            some: {
              userId: userId
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    },
    // ... include options
  });
}
```

**After:**

```typescript
async getProjectById(projectId: string, userId: string) {
  const project = await prisma.project.findFirst({
    where: {
      id: projectId,
      OR: [
        { ownerId: userId },
        {
          members: {
            some: {
              userId: userId
            }
          }
        },
        // NEW: Allow users with pending invitations to view the project
        {
          invitations: {
            some: {
              developerId: userId,
              status: 'PENDING'
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    },
    // ... include options
  });
}
```

## How It Works Now

1. **User receives invitation** → Invitation is created with `status: 'PENDING'` and `developerId: userId`
2. **User views invitations page** → Sees the invitation with project details
3. **User clicks on project** → Can now view project details because they have a pending invitation
4. **User accepts invitation** → Becomes a project member
5. **User can still access project** → Now has access as a member

## Access Control Matrix

| User Type         | Can View Project? | Can Edit Project? | Can Manage Members? |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------------- |
| Owner             | ✅ Yes            | ✅ Yes            | ✅ Yes              |
| Admin Member      | ✅ Yes            | ✅ Yes            | ✅ Yes              |
| Regular Member    | ✅ Yes            | ⚠️ Limited        | ❌ No               |
| Invited (Pending) | ✅ Yes            | ❌ No             | ❌ No               |
| Not Related       | ❌ No             | ❌ No             | ❌ No               |

## Testing

To test the fix:

1. **User A** creates a project
2. **User A** sends an invitation to **User B**
3. **User B** logs in and goes to invitations page
4. **User B** clicks on the project name
5. ✅ **User B** should now see the project details (no error)
6. **User B** accepts the invitation
7. ✅ **User B** still has access as a member

## Additional Notes

- The invitation system now properly shows invitations on the receiver's side
- Users can preview projects before accepting invitations
- Once accepted, users maintain access as project members
- Declined invitations are removed and users lose preview access
